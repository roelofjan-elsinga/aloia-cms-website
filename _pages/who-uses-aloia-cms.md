Aloia CMS is already used in production for a few websites. 
The content management system gets improved with every website that's developed with it.
These are some of the websites that are built with Aloia CMS:

- Plant care for beginners ([https://plantcareforbeginners.com](https://plantcareforbeginners.com))
