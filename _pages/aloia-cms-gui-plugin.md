The Aloia CMS GUI plugin provides you with a management dashboard you can include in your Laravel project to work on the content for Aloia CMS. This way you can work on your content through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the browser, anywhere in the world.

## Ready for extension

The management dashboard is built in such a way that it's easy to extend with additional features.

This is the default dashboard. As you can see, it supports the included content types for Aloia CMS GUI, but it doesn't have to stop there. Aloia CMS is very extendable, but so is its Graphical User Interface. You can add custom content to any page by overwriting the views and even add new fields to "Page" and "Article" to make the content work for you, instead the other way around.
