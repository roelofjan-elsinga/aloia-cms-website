# Documentation

Aloia CMS is a drop-in flat file CMS built on top of Laravel. 
You won't need to rebuild your entire application to be able to offer CMS capabilities, 
you can simply include the CMS as a library and start writing.

This documentation is here to make it as easy as possible to get started with Aloia CMS.

## What is Aloia CMS?
Great question! Aloia CMS is a flat file CMS that does all the dirty work developers don't want to do when 
making a custom content management system. Yet still allowing developers to control every single aspect of presenting 
the content. The fact that Aloia CMS is a flat file CMS means that it doesn't require a database of any kind. 
All content is saved on the filesystem in a variety of file types (json, txt, html, md).
Since data is not saved in a database, serving content is almost instant. People like fast websites, 
so this content management system won't get into your way when it comes to performance, like some others.

## The goal of Aloia CMS
Creating a custom CMS is very tedious, because there is so much more to do than just managing pages. 
So you rather just use an off-the-shelf CMS to do all of this dirty work for you. 
Now you have a great base to start from. But now someone asks you to change something that requires you to 
tweak some of the code. You're now finding yourself in a situation where you have to work around choices 
others made about your content and it just feels dirty. 

What if all of the content management was taken care of for you, but you had full control over 
the presentation of your content? That's where Aloia CMS comes in.
