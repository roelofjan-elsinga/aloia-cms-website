# Built-in content types

There are 4 built-in content types you can use without any additional set-up:

- Page
- Article
- ContentBlock
- MetaTag

To find out how you can use these content types in your project, you can read more about it at

You can also add your own custom content types as described at 
[Creating content types]({% link _documentation/creating-content-types.md %}).
