# Available Plugins

As the core package is very bare bones, you have the ability to include some official plugins for the CMS. 
You're welcome to create your own plugins as well, these official plugins are just a nice starting point.

- [**Aloia CMS Auto Publish**](https://github.com/roelofjan-elsinga/aloia-cms-publish), a plugin that provides the ability to automatically publish blog posts and generate sitemaps/RSS feeds.
