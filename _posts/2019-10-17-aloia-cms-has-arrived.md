The ongoing development of Flat File CMS has been going really well. 
In the past few months there have been several new plugins and major improvements in the system. 
So it's about time the CMS gets a proper name: Aloia CMS.

You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/roelofjan-elsinga/flat-file-cms). 
Here you can contribute and start using the CMS.
