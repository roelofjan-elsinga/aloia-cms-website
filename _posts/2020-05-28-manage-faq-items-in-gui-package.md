SEO is the most important way to make your website discoverable in the search engines. To make this a little easier, 
you can now manage FAQ items right in the GUI package of Aloia CMS. This allows more people to build content that's 
search engine friendly. 

FAQ items for articles and blog posts are a great way to make your content more discoverable. When your FAQ items 
get chosen as the most helpful by Google, you could get a lot more search traffic from this. To increase the chances 
you can benefit from this, we've baked it right into the CMS GUI. You can choose to not use this as well of course.

If you're using the core CMS only, you won't notice this change at all, as this is something you could have implemented 
yourself since version 1.0.0.
